## About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Karachi, Pakistan, currently in my final year of BS Computer Science at NED University. I build production-ready systems for real clients — not toy projects.

Right now I'm the **sole architect and developer** of a workflow-driven Staffing CRM for a US-based client — built from scratch, deployed to production, and covering everything from multi-tenant org management to timesheet invoicing and automated email pipelines. Before that I shipped a full ATS platform, a university inventory system, an LMS with an AI chatbot, and a data warehouse with a Gemini-powered RAG layer.

Give me a stack. Give me a problem. I'll figure it out and ship it.
